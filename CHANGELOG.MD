## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Documentation
- Updated README to replace `bun coverage` with `bun test:coverage` for accuracy.
- Updated README to include a link to the new browser example.
- Corrected local file path links in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to use relative paths.
- Refined the browser example (`docs/examples/browser.md`) by removing verbose console logs and simplifying error handling logic for better clarity.
- Clarified time complexity for dynamic route matching in `README.md` to note the potential impact of plugins (O(k*P) in worst-case, closer to O(k) in average cases).
